### About the dataset:
The MPD contains a million user-generated playlists. These playlists
were created during the period of January 2010 through October 2017.
Each playlist in the MPD contains a playlist title, the track list
(including track metadata) editing information (last edit time, 
number of playlist edits) and other miscellaneous information 
about the playlist.

## Obtaining The Data
Proceed with these steps to download Spotify's dataset (33 Gb) and convert the data into a memory-efficient format (~ 5 Gb) for use on the Databricks platform:
1. Download Spotify's official [dataset](recsys-challenge.spotify.com/dataset) and place the 'data' folder into the root folder of the project. 
2. Run the following command:
```
python restructureData.py 
```
This script populates the \data_csv folder with the data that can be used to create a Databricks table.

## 1. Exploratory data analysis:
```
EDA.ipynb
```
## 2. Using Neural Collaborative Filtering approach on a subset of data:
```
Neural-Collaborative-Filtering.ipynb
```

## 3. Training & Using Spark MLib Alternative Least Squares algorithm on all of data:
```
Spark-MLib-ALS.ipynb
```
